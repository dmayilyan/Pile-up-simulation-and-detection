Pile-up-simulation-and-detection
================================

Pile-up event simulation and detection using biggest difference in the height method.

Program was written for woking under Cern ROOT program.

To run the program call PhotoElec() function, where argument should the energy of the incoming particle. Program is modified for BGO crystals.

Addition of slope change speed logic may(will) improve the results, but wasn't implemented due to time restrictions.
